	Partial fix for bug #44457.

	* camel-mime-part-utils.c
	(simple_data_wrapper_construct_from_parser): Make sure to set
	rawtext to FALSE if we successfully convert the text to UTF-8.

	* camel-data-wrapper.c (camel_data_wrapper_init): Default the
	value of rawtext to TRUE instead of FALSE. This way if the mailer
	decides to try displaying a non-textual part as text, it knows
	that it needs to convert the content to UTF-8.

	* camel-uid-cache.c (camel_uid_cache_new): Create the directory
	with mode 0777 and the cache file itself with mode 0666. Let the
	user's umask filter the permissions. Instead of saving the fd on
	the Cache object, instead save the filename. Use camel_read()
	instead of expecting read() to just always work without getting an
	EINTR/etc.
	(maybe_write_uid): Don't do anything if cache->fd == -1, this
	means an error has occured in a previous callback. Replace the 2
	calls to write() with camel_write() and check their return
	values. If either of them fails, set cache->fd to -1 (GHashTable
	doesn't give us a way to abort foreach'ing thru the table).
	(camel_uid_cache_save): Save to a temp file instead of overwriting
	the original. Do proper error checking, etc. Also added some
	smarts about whether to try and overwrite the old cache even if we
	haven't successfully saved all the uids in the cache.
	(camel_uid_cache_destroy): Free the cache->filename, no longer
	need to close (cache->fd).

	* camel-text-index.c (text_index_normalise): use g_utf8_strdown
	properly.

	* camel-mime-message.c (find_best_encoding): Add the
	CAMEL_BESTENC_TEXT bit to enctype if the part is a text part.

	* camel-mime-filter-bestenc.c
	(camel_mime_filter_bestenc_get_best_encoding): If we have any
	nul-bytes or if the content is non-text and contains any 8bit
	octets, we need to use base64. Fixes bug #44344.
