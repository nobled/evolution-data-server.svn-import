	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.h
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Added exception to call,
	and fixed caller.

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-search.c
	(camel_mbox_folder_search_by_expression): Major changes, to use
	the sexp evaluator from filter/filter-sexp.c to implement the
	searching.
	(func_body_contains): Changed to support multiple strings in 1
	command (results or'd together)

	* url-util.c (g_url_new): Fixed a typo (colon == 0 isn't right),
	and made it so full url's are absolute pathed (Dan, this is how it
	has to work!).  Also, always include a path part, even if it is an
	empty string.

	* providers/mbox/Makefile.am (libcamelmbox_la_LIBADD): Added

	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (_set_name): Setup index
