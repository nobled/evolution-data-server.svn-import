	* camel-sendmail-transport.c (sendmail_send_to): Fix file descriptor leak

2005-09-16  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-sendmail-transport.c: Use g_ascii_strcasecmp() instead of
	strcasecmp(). The strings we are comparing are just ASCII anyway,
	so spell it out that we really do need ASCII casefolding only.

2005-04-17  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@debian.org>

	** See bug #300891
	
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define
	CAMEL_EXPLICIT_TRANSLATION_DOMAIN.

	* camel-sendmail-provider.c (camel_provider_module_init):
	set translation_domain in CamelProvider struct.

** refer to main changelog for earlier changes
