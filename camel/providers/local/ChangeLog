	* camel-spool-summary.c (spool_summary_sync_full): Use g_mkstemp()

2007-05-14  Jules Colding  <colding@omesc.com>

	* camel-mh-summary.c (mh_summary_next_uid_string): Do not close() if (fd == -1).

	* camel-spool-summary.c (spool_summary_sync_full): alloca() changed into malloc(). 
	alloca() has undefined behaviour for stack overflow so it shouldn't really be used 
	unless there is a *very* good reason. Cleanups related to this fix as well. Do not 
	close() if (fd == -1).

2007-04-05  Ross Burton  <ross@openedhand.com>

	* camel-local-store.c: (get_folder):
	* camel-mbox-store.c: (get_folder), (create_folder),
	(rename_folder):
	* camel-spool-store.c: (spool_get_meta_path):
	Use g_mkdir_with_parents (#383686).

	** Fixes BGO #413268
	
	* camel-mbox-store.c:
	* camel-local-store.c: (rename_folder), (delete_folder):  Rename/delete meta summary file.
	
2006-08-23  Srinivasa Ragavan  <sragavan@novell.com>

	** Fix for bug #347905 by Matt Davey
	
	* camel-local-store.c: (create_folder): patch to fix mail folder 
	creation with MH back end.

2006-06-15  Andre Klapper  <a9016009@gmx.de>

	* camel-maildir-folder.c: 
	* camel-mbox-folder.c: 
	* camel-mh-folder.c:
	changing "cancelled" to "canceled" in user-visible strings.
	Fixes bug #342163.

2006-06-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (summary_update, mbox_summary_check)
	(mbox_summary_sync): Use g_stat() instead of plain stat() for full
	Unicode pathname support on Win32. These instances had gone
	unnoticed earlier.

2006-06-09  Chris Heath  <chris@heathens.co.nz>

	* camel-local-summary.c (message_info_new_from_header): Fix memory leak
	* camel-mbox-summary.c (message_info_new_from_header): Ditto.
	Fixes bug #335423.

2006-03-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (summary_update, mbox_summary_sync_full),
	(mbox_summary_sync_full, mbox_summary_sync_quick): Use O_LARGEFILE
	when opening the mbox file.

	* camel-mbox-store.c (get_folder): Use O_LARGEFILE when opening
	the mbox file.

	* camel-mbox-folder.c (mbox_append_message, mbox_get_message): Use
	O_LARGEFILE when opening the mbox file.

	** See bug 160889 on bugzilla.novell.com

	* camel-mbox-store.c: ignore *.ev-summary-meta extensions 
	when displaying folder lists

2005-12-09  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-mbox-folder.c: Just #define O_BINARY as 0 on Unix, less
	ifdefs that way. Should really do this in some suitable header, of
	course, and not duplicate here and there.

2005-12-09  David Malcolm  <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* camel-local-folder.c: restore missing declarations for non-Win32 
	systems.

	* camel-mbox-folder.c: avoid use of O_BINARY on non-Win32 systems.

2005-12-08  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* *.c: Use gstdio wrappers. Use GLib portable path manipulation
	API. No symlinks on Win32. Use GDir instead of dirent.

	* camel-local-provider.c: Compile in only the mbox provider on Win32.

	* camel-mbox-folder.c: Bypass locking so far on Win32. Should
	implement, though, several threads in Evo might be accessing the
	same mbox folder.

	* camel-mbox-store.c: No inode numbers on Win32, but no symlinks
	either, so bypass the code to avoid visiting the same folder
	twice.

2005-09-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* camel-local-summary.c: Use g_ascii_strcasecmp() instead of
	strcasecmp(). The strings we are comparing are just ASCII anyway,
	so spell it out that we really do need ASCII casefolding only.

2005-08-22  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (mbox_summary_sync_quick): removed some
	unecessary debug.

2005-08-12  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-local-folder.c (camel_local_folder_construct): dont sync
	folder on open, wait for a refresh_info to do it.

2005-08-12  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use NO_UNDEFINED. Link with libcamel-provider,
	libcamel and CAMEL_LIBS. Include the mh, maildir and spool stores
	only on Unix.

	* camel-local-provider.c: Include the mh, maildir and spool stores
	only on Unix.

2005-04-17  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@debian.org>

	** See bug #300891
	
	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): define
	CAMEL_EXPLICIT_TRANSLATION_DOMAIN.

	* camel-local-provider.c (camel_provider_module_init):
	set translation_domain in CamelProvider structs.

2005-08-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #311639.

	* camel-mh-store.c (folders_update): add a rename mode, fix
	callers.
	(folders_scan): pass top to folder_info_build, otherwise
	get_folder_info doesn't work right.  Fix the check for subfolder
	test.

2005-06-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #303225

	* camel-local-provider.c (local_url_equal): remove the checks for
	fields not used/appropriate for local resources.

2005-04-12  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-local-provider.c (check_equal): make "" equal NULL for
	comparative purposes.

2005-03-18  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (mbox_summary_sync_quick): use a different
	fd for the mime parser, so the fd doesn't get closed twice.

2005-03-16  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #73401?

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (mbox_info_set_user_tag)
	(mbox_info_set_user_flag): do not flag xevchange here, these
	values are not stored in x-evolution-header anymore.

2005-02-24  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #57185

	* camel-mh-summary.c (mh_summary_sync_message): removed.  dont
	re-write people's mh mail just to add an xev header.  we should be
	looking at .mh_sequences or something.  Partial fix for #57185.

2005-02-24  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #59507

	* camel-spool-store.c (spool_get_full_path): handle mbox/elm cases
	explictly, not based on stat of path.
	(spool_get_meta_path): store all meta files in ~/.evolution
	somewhere.

	* camel-local-folder.c (camel_local_folder_construct): remove the
	special case test for a direct folder, leave it to subclasses to
	decide.

	* camel-local-store.c (local_get_trash, local_get_junk): calculate
	the state file based on the new store get_meta_path calls.  Also
	use the CAMEL_VJUNK_NAME, etc.

	* camel-local-folder.c, camel-local-store.c: Moved the
	get_meta_path and get_full_path routines to the store instead of
	the folder.  fix all subclasses.

2005-02-23  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See bug #71812

	* camel-mbox-summary.c (camel_mbox_summary_sync_mbox): clear the
	working flags after we've successfully performed a full sync, they
	are no longer needed.

2005-02-01  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-maildir-store.c (get_folder_info): set the
	folder type of inbox properly.

	* started new chnagelog.
