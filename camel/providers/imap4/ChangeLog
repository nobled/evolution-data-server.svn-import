	* camel-imap4-provider.c: Added command option.

	* camel-imap4-store.c (connect_to_server_process): Implemented.
	(connect_to_server_wrapper): Call above when appropriate.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_parse_resp_code):
	handle CAMEL_IMAP4_RESP_CODE_ALERT explicitly in the switch
	statement and have it break out. This prevents the code from
	getting to the "unknown resp-code" code path that prints a warning
	unnecessarily.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_iterate): On connect
	failures, disconnect our streams and set our engine state to
	DISCONNECTED.

	* camel-imap4-summary.c (untagged_fetch_all): Get rid of the
	warnings about the mlist string not being strdup'd by the string
	pool.

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_get_folder_info): In the ic1 error
	case, xfer the ic1 exception, not the ic0 exception (which might
	not even exist). Fixes bug #71919.

Refer to main changelog for earlier changes.
