2005-02-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-search.c (imap4_body_contains): If we're in offline
	mode, let the parent implementation perform the search.

2005-02-04  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): always get the
	subscription info.
	(camel_imap4_store_class_init): added a fixme about
	folder_subscribed not being implemented.

2005-02-02  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_build_folder_info): Set the
	CAMEL_FOLDER_SUBSCRIBED bit on the fi->flags if the info was
	gotten via an LSUB response.
	(imap4_build_folder_info): If our caller has requested
	subscription info, make sure to get it.
	(imap4_subscription_info): Get whether or not a folder is
	subscribed.

2005-02-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-summary.c (imap4_header_load): Changed to have the
	'have_mlist' bit be a summary flag rather than a new value stored
	in the summary header.
	(imap4_header_save): No longer need to save the have_mlist value
	ourselves.
	(camel_imap4_summary_flush_updates): Updated to use summary flags
	for have_mlist instead.

2005-02-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-provider.c: Added command option.
	Reset back to imap4:// uris.

	* camel-imap4-store.c (connect_to_server_process): Implemented.
	(connect_to_server_wrapper): Call above when appropriate.

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_parse_resp_code):
	handle CAMEL_IMAP4_RESP_CODE_ALERT explicitly in the switch
	statement and have it break out. This prevents the code from
	getting to the "unknown resp-code" code path that prints a warning
	unnecessarily.

2005-01-31  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-engine.c (camel_imap4_engine_iterate): On connect
	failures, disconnect our streams and set our engine state to
	DISCONNECTED.

2005-01-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* camel-imap4-summary.c (untagged_fetch_all): Get rid of the
	warnings about the mlist string not being strdup'd by the string
	pool.

	* camel-imap4-store.c (imap4_get_folder_info): In the ic1 error
	case, xfer the ic1 exception, not the ic0 exception (which might
	not even exist). Fixes bug #71919.
