	* camel-imap-command.c (imap_read_untagged): Continue reading data
	until we've read all the data (camel_stream_read() makes no
	guarantee that it will read n bytes in a single call).

	* camel-imap-folder.c (imap_sync_online): READ-ONLY doesn't mean
	we can't sync flags, allow flag syncing even in READ-ONLY mode
	since the RFC states that flags listed in PERMANENTFLAGS are
	always settable.
