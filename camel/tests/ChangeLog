	* message/Makefile.am (LDADD): Reorder: put libcamel after
	libcameltest.

	** See bug #310496.

	* smime/pgp.c (main): disable ourselves if CAMEL_TEST_GPG isn't
	set.  In reality i've never gotten it to work and it depends on a
	lot of things which change from distro to distro (e.g, gpg-agent
	completely breaks it).

	* misc/rfc2047.c: fixed compilation of test, and removed the
	broken cases - oddly enough, they break make check.

	* Added new changelog for test, sick of them going into main one.
