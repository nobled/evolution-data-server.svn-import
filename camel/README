			A generic Messaging Library

Introduction:
-------------

Camel is a generic messaging library. It supports the standard 
messaging system for receiving and sending messages. It is the 
messaging backend for Evolution.

The name "camel" stands for ... nothing. Open area of development there.
You know, that "bazaar" thing. Maybe could we organize a big contest on
gnome-list to find the best explanation :)

Camel draws heavily from JavaMail and the IMAP4rev1 RFC. People
wanting to hack on a provider should read the JavaMail API
specification, but CMC and MAPI are of interest too.

 
Organization:
-------------

The library is roughly a set of abstract classes, some kind of generic
"interfaces" (IDL interfaces, not Java interfaces).

Particular implementations are called providers.

Here are the basic objects:

* CamelService : An abstract class representing an access to a server.
Handles the connection and authentication to any server.

* CamelStore (CamelService): A hierarchy of folders on a server.

* CamelFolder : An object containing messages. A folder is always
associated with a store.

* CamelMessage : An object contained in folders. Is defined by a set
of attributes and a content. (Attributes include: the date it was
received, the sender address, .....)

* CamelTransport (CamelService): A way to send messages.
