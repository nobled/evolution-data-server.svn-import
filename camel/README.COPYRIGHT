Important note for Camel hackers:
---------------------------------

Camel has been a lot of work, and has been conceived to be general
enough to be used outside the gnome-mailer. It is possible in the
future that it is used in software with licenses incompatible with the
GPL. For this reason, the copyright has to be owned by a unique
entity.  Be sure, however, that Camel will always be available under
the GPL.  Significant authors will always be consulted before any
special use of Camel. Moreover, in special situations, they may be
given the authorization to use Camel with a license different than the
GPL.

Thus, when adding code in Camel, always add the following lines at the
begining of the file:
