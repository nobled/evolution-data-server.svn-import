This directory contains .def files for some of the DLLs in EDS. They
are used to build bootstrap import libraries for these DLLs in advance
before they have actually been built. This is necessary because
Evolution's shared libraries have circular dependencies, and one can't
have unresolved symbols when building shared libraries on Win32.

These .def files aren't used when building the actual DLLs in
question. They are only used to produce bootstrap import libraries for
them. Thus a .def file for libFOO here doesn't list all the actual
entry points in libFOO, only those that are used by other DLLs that
are built before libFOO. When the actual libFOO is built, we rely on
the GNU linker's auto-export to export all public symbols.
