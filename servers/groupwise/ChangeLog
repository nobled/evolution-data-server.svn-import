	* Makefile.am: re-enabled create-account test program, it does not need
	the calendar libraries.

	* e-gw-container.h: fixed typo in function name.

	* e-gw-item.c (e_gw_item_to_cal_component): return NULL if the item
	type is not supported.

	* Makefile.am: disable test programs until we remove all calendar
	dependencies.

	Moved Groupwise API library to its own directory, for easy reuse in
	both calendar and addressbook backends.
