	* lib/e2k-autoconfig.c
	* lib/e2k-context.c: Include appropriate headers on Win32. 

	* lib/e2k-autoconfig.c: Drop inclusion of
	libedataserver/e-account.h and libedataserver/e-account-list.h,
	that API is not used here.
	(find_global_catalog): Add Win32 implementation.
	(find_olson_timezone): Use g_win32_getlocale() on Win32 instead of
	the usually nonexistent LANG environment variable.
	(read_config): Form path to connector.conf at run-time for the

	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-foreign.c
	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-webdav.c: Use gstdio wrappers.
	
	* lib/e2k-context.c: Define strtok_r() using strtok() on Windows,
	where strtok() is MT-safe. Wrap socket API calls with simple
	macros for Unix/Winsock portability. Use
	g_io_channel_win32_new_socket() on Windows.

	* lib/e2k-global-catalog-ldap.h: Include winldap.h on Windows. Add
	some OpenLDAP macros that aren't present in winldap.h.

	* lib/e2k-global-catalog.c: Remove duplicate inclusion of ldap.h,
	it's already included by e2k-global-catalog-ldap.h
	(finalize): g_free() works fine on NULL pointers.
	(connect_ldap, get_ldap_connection): Rename ldap_connect() to
	connect_ldap() to avoid clash with the ldap_connect() function in
	the LDAP API.
	(connect_ldap): Use WINNT authentication on Windows.

	* storage/exchange-account.c (setup_account_hierarchies): Use
	g_dir* instead of dirent API for portability.

	Windows). Link with all needed libraries for the benefit of
	-no-undefined.

	implementation, already have it as e_util_mkdir_hier() in
	libedataserver/e-util.c.
	(sanitize_path): Must return something in all cases, this function
	is not void. Why did gcc let this through with just a warning?

	* storage/e-folder-exchange.c
	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-foreign.c: Use e_xml_parse_file()
	instead of xmlParseFile(), as that doesn't take UTF-8 filenames on
	Windows. Use e_xml_save_file() for the same reason.

	* storage/e-folder-exchange.c (e_xml_get_child_by_name): Remove,
	now in libedataserver/e-xml-utils.c.

	* storage/exchange-account.c (exchange_account_set_password):
	Do compile even if not HAVE_KRB5, but always return failure. Means
	less ifdefs elsewhere.
	(e_filename_make_safe): Remove this function which isn't used,
	especially as there is an exact duplicate in evolution's
	e-util/e-util.c. If it eventually is needed also somewhere in
	e-d-s, move it to libedataserver instead.

2005-12-12  Irene Huang <Irene.Huang@sun.com>

	* lib/e2k-autoconfig.c: (e2k_validate_user): If password
	exists, used the remembered password to do the

	* storage/exchange-account.c (exchange_account_connect): set
	account->priv->connecting flag to FALSE on NULL password.

	* storage/e-shell-marshal.list: Add NONE:INT.

2005-12-07  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* storage/Makefile.am: Link with libedatasererui's bootstrap
	import library on Win32. Link also with libedataserver. Move
	libexchange.la and libxntlm.la from LDFLAGS to LIBADD. Install
	e-shell-marshal.h (for the benefit of evolution-exchange, which
	used to generate its own copy, but having several copies of the
	same file in different places is confusing).

2005-11-26  Sushma Rai  <rsushma@novell.com>

	* storage/exchange-account.c (exchange_account_remove_folder)
	(get_password)(exchange_account_connect): Fix for compile time warnings.
