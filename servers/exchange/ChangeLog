	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-foreign.c: Use e_xml_parse_file()
	instead of xmlParseFile(), as that doesn't take UTF-8 filenames on
	Windows. Use e_xml_save_file() for the same reason.

	* storage/e-folder-exchange.c (e_xml_get_child_by_name): Remove,
	now in libedataserver/e-xml-utils.c.

	* storage/exchange-account.c (exchange_account_set_password):
	Do compile even if not HAVE_KRB5, but always return failure. Means
	less ifdefs elsewhere.
	(e_filename_make_safe): Remove this function which isn't used,
	especially as there is an exact duplicate in evolution's
	e-util/e-util.c. If it eventually is needed also somewhere in
	e-d-s, move it to libedataserver instead.

2005-12-12  Irene Huang <Irene.Huang@sun.com>

	e-shell-marshal.h (for the benefit of evolution-exchange, which
	used to generate its own copy, but having several copies of the
	same file in different places is confusing).
